i have never liked the box of knives 
you said was a paradox because you’re kind 
but withstood a childhood that robbed you blind 
of love that was safe and so you learned to fight

what do i do with this stuff? 
it seems like yesterday i called you up 
i had a terrible case of the past 
i didn’t know how to get it off 
i didn’t know how to get it off 

and you took 
your machete 
and you sliced through the vines that wrapped around me 
and you said 
i don’t know what i’m doing 
so i’ll just keep on cutting 
it’s worth a little blood to get your arms free

what do i do with this stuff? 
it seems like yesterday i was in love 
i kept of covering the soft parts up 
i didn’t know how to get them off 
i didn’t know how to get them off 

and you took your machete 
and you hacked through the woods in the surrounding 
and you said 
i don’t know where i’m going 
i just know that i’m heading from 
the dead things piling up behind me 

and you took 
your machete 
and you carved out a path to my chest and you said see 
there’s nothing not worth keeping 
you’ve felt so many beatings 
but 
nothing’s going to work if you believe me 
nothing’s going to work if you believe me

i have never liked the box of knives 
i took it to the oceanside the day you died 
i stood out on the dock 
no matter how hard i tried 
i couldn’t drop them in 
and i collapsed and cried: 

what do i do with this stuff? 
it seems like yesterday you were alive 
and it’s as if you never really died 
and it’s as if you never really died. 

and you took 
your machete 
and you said boo guess who 
but seriously, beauty 
you said 
see ? 
you get the drill now don’t you 
it’s not a will or won’t 
you can’t keep making symbols out of nothing 

so i took your machete 
and i sliced off your head and you laughed 
and you said see 
it’s just like anti matter 
it’s dumbo’s magic feather 
you don’t need me here to cut you 
you don’t need me here to cut you 
you don’t need me here to cut you 
you don’t need me here to cut you
